# Intrusion Detection Using NSL-KDD Dataset with Machine Learning

A Python-based intrusion detection system (IDS) leveraging machine learning techniques to accurately classify network traffic (normal vs. attack) using the NSL-KDD dataset.

## Overview

This project implements the following pipeline:

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
   - Reads the NSL-KDD dataset (training and testing).  
   - Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), handles missing values, encodes categorical features, scales numeric data, and balances classes if necessary.

2. **Feature Processing & Selection**  
   - Applies feature selection techniques (e.g., Information Gain, Recursive Feature Elimination, or custom algorithms) to extract the most impactful features for detection.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Trains classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, or others.  
   - Evaluates using metrics like **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**, and provides a confusion matrix.

4. **Performance Analysis**  
   - Charts and summary statistics elucidate how different models and feature subsets perform on intrusion detection tasks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adhitasinha/Intrusion-Detection-Using-NSL--KDD-Dataset-using-Machine-Learning.git
   cd Intrusion-Detection-Using-NSL--KDD-Dataset-using-Machine-Learning
````

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Typical dependencies might include:

   * `numpy`, `pandas`
   * `scikit-learn`
   * `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
   * `joblib` (for model saving)
   * `jupyter` (if notebooks are included)

---

## Dataset

The project expects the **NSL-KDD** dataset files:

* `KDDTrain+.txt` (training)
* `KDDTest+.txt` (testing)

Place these files in a `data/` directory at the project root.
You can download them from publicly available sources such as \[Kaggle NSL-KDD dataset] or the original repository.

---

## Usage

### Running the Main Script

To perform the full pipeline (preprocessing → training → evaluation), run:

```bash
python main.py --train data/KDDTrain+.txt --test data/KDDTest+.txt
```

This script will:

* Preprocess the data (clean, encode, scale, select features)
* Train specified classifiers
* Output evaluation metrics and plots (e.g. confusion matrix, ROC curves)

### Using Notebooks (optional)

If Jupyter notebooks are included (e.g., `exploratory_analysis.ipynb`):

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then navigate to and run through the notebook to explore data and results step-by-step.

## Results

Some typical outcomes reported in similar projects include:

| Classifier          | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | \~85-90% | \~0.85    | \~0.85 | \~0.85   |
| Random Forest       | \~90-95% | \~0.90    | \~0.90 | \~0.90   |
| SVM / Decision Tree | \~88-92% | \~0.88    | \~0.88 | \~0.88   |

These scores are for illustration; refer to your project's actual outputs for precise results.
